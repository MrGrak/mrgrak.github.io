<h1>What makes this Design Fast?</h1>

<h3>First of all, you can write faster particle systems than this on the CPU.</h3>

<p>

This is not the fastest way to write particle systems. This design does however exist in a<br>
comfortable spot between 'simple' and 'fast enough'. I would argue that this type<br>
of Particle System design is a good balance of easy to use and fast to update + draw.<br>
<br>
But what makes it fast? That is primarily due to using small Structs in Arrays, and iterating<br>
them sequentially. You will also notice that this design generates very little garbage. In fact,<br>
the only real garbage it creates is the string that is written to the title of the window for<br>
timing purposes. All other data either lives within a stack frame, or is stored on the heap<br>
in a public static class, which means it's never garbage collected.<br>

<h3>Here's a capture of the PSys booting up, with Diagnostic Tools showing garbage collections.</h3>

<p>
Frametimes on a i52500k are around 2 milliseconds for around 21,000 particles, which ain't bad.<br>
Thanks for reading.<br>
