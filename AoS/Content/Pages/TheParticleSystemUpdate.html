<p>
The overall goals of the Update() method are described as step 1 and step 2.<br>
First, we'll animate, move, and age the particles. <br>
Then we'll randomly spawn fire and rain particles, so there's particles for <br>
step 1 to actually work with.<br>
<br>
Let's look at each section in detail, starting with wind.<br>
</p>
<br>





<textarea rows="7" readonly>
//increase wind counter
windCounter += 0.015f;
//get left or right horizontal value for wind
float wind = (float)Math.Sin(windCounter) * 0.03f;
</textarea>

<p>
WindCounter is a value used to animate particles left and right. We apply<br>
a Sin() to this value (which is incremented slowly), and we get back a<br>
value that oscillates back and forth between negative and positive. We<br>
will apply this final value as an acceleration to the particles later.<br>
</p>
<br>










<textarea rows="6" readonly>
//store locals for this heap data
int width = Data.GDM.PreferredBackBufferWidth;
int height = Data.GDM.PreferredBackBufferHeight;
</textarea>

<p>
We're going to be heap reading this value each time, for each particle, unless<br>
we store that value on the stack. So here we copy the values for the game's<br>
width and height to ints within the scope of the Update() method.<br>
Now we begin looping the array of particle structs.<br>
</p>
<br>








<textarea rows="10" readonly>
//step 1 - update all active particles
int s = size;
for (int i = 0; i < s; i++)
{   //particle active, age + check id / behavior
	if (data[i].Id > 0)
	{   //create a local copy
		Particle P = data[i];
		
</textarea>

<p>
We store the size on the stack, and start checking particle structs to find<br>
active ones. A particle is 'active' if it's Id does not equal the Inactive<br>
value of 0. So, if the enum value is greater than 0, this particle must be<br>
a Fire or Rain particle. It may be a value higher than a Fire or Rain particle<br>
as well, but we don't handle that case in this example. Once we have located<br>
an active particle, we create a local particle struct that is a copy of the<br>
active particle. Once we have a local copy ready, we can begin work on it.<br>
<br>
Let's start by aging the particle, so particles will expire and become inactive<br>
after a certain time.<br>
</p>
<br>







<textarea rows="22" readonly>
//age active particles
P.age++;

//affect particles based on id
if (P.Id == ParticleID.Fire)
{   //fire rises, gravity does not affect it
	P.physics.accY -= gravity;
	P.physics.accY -= 0.05f;
	//has longer life than rain
	if (P.age > 300)
	{ P.Id = ParticleID.Inactive; }
}
else if (P.Id == ParticleID.Rain)
{   //rain falls (at different speeds)
	P.physics.accY = Rand.Next(0, 100) * 0.001f;
	//has shorter life than fire
	if (P.age > 200)
	{ P.Id = ParticleID.Inactive; }
}
</textarea>

<p>
We increase the particle's age first. Then we check the particle Id,<br>
and based on the Id we Update the particle differently. Fire, for example,<br>
gets a negative acceleration of the gravity value, which will negate the<br>
gravity that we will apply later to all particles. We could instead choose<br>
to only apply gravity to the Rain particle, but this works too. Then we<br>
apply some lift to the fire particle, so it will rise off the ground and<br>
move up. Moving Up on the Y axis is negative, and moving down is positive.<br>
<br>
Then we check the particles age, and based on age and Id, we expire the particle,<br>
which simply sets it's Id to inactive. We repeat this same process for Rain,<br>
but with Rain we apply additional downwards acceleration, so Rain falls down a<br>
bit faster than gravity would normally pull it.<br>
<br>
Now let's apply some additional forces like gravity and wind, and move the particles.<br>
</p>
<br>








<textarea rows="22" readonly>
//add gravity to push down
P.physics.accY += gravity;
//add wind to push left/right
P.physics.accX += wind;

//calculate velocity using current and previous pos
float velocityX = P.physics.X - P.physics.preX;
float velocityY = P.physics.Y - P.physics.preY;

//store previous positions (the current positions)
P.physics.preX = P.physics.X;
P.physics.preY = P.physics.Y;

//set next positions using current + velocity + acceleration
P.physics.X = P.physics.X + velocityX + P.physics.accX;
P.physics.Y = P.physics.Y + velocityY + P.physics.accY;

//clear accelerations
P.physics.accX = 0; P.physics.accY = 0;
</textarea>

<p>
How this physics system works is: we calculate the difference between the<br>
last and current positions to get a velocity. Then we add the velocity to<br>
the current positions, along with this frame's accelerations. Then we clear<br>
the accelerations. This design makes it easy to 'push' particles around, as<br>
we only need to modify their acceleration values. For example, we apply a<br>
gravitational value to the Y acceleration of every particle, each frame.<br>
This has the net effect of pulling all particles downwards. We also apply<br>
a wind value to each particle's X axis accelerations each frame, which has<br>
the net effect of pushing and pulling particles left and right over time.<br>
This is a fast, simple, and easy to work with physics system that can be<br>
extended to probably meet your needs. Add collisions, as an excersize.<br>
<br>
Now let's cull particles and keep track of them.<br>
</p>
<br>






<textarea rows="13" readonly>
//cull particle if it goes off screen
if (P.physics.X < 0 || P.physics.X > width)
{ P.Id = ParticleID.Inactive; }
else if (P.physics.Y < 0 || P.physics.Y > height)
{ P.Id = ParticleID.Inactive; }

//decrement active value upon particle expiration
if (P.Id == ParticleID.Inactive) { active--; }

//write local to heap
data[i] = P;
</textarea>

<p>
We check to see if a particle has exceed the bounds of the game window, and if<br>
it has we simply set it's Id to be inactive. This applies for both X and Y axis.<br>
At the very end of the method, we check the Particle Id and see if it's Inactive.<br>
If this is true, an active particle has expired and become inactive, so we decrement<br>
the active count by one. Finally, we write our local particle struct to the actual<br>
particle array, saving our work to the heap.<br>
<br>
That concludes Step 1 of the Particle System. Now here's Step 2, it's much smaller.
<br>
</p>
<br>












<textarea rows="11" readonly>
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{   //step 2 - randomly spawn rain + fire
	Spawn(ParticleID.Rain,
		Rand.Next(0, width),
		0, 0, 0);
	Spawn(ParticleID.Fire,
		Rand.Next(0, width),
		height, 0, 0);
}
</textarea>

<p>
100 times each frame, we randomly spawn a Rain and Fire particle along the top and<br>
bottom edges of the game window. So, we are spawning 200 particles each frame, at<br>
60 fps. In one second, we will spawn 200 * 60 = 12,000 particles. Our particle system<br>
is setup to handle 30,000 particles. We also need to keep in mind that the particles<br>
will be moving, and they will become inactive if they go off screen.<br>
<br>
Finally, let's take a look at the Draw() Method.<br>
