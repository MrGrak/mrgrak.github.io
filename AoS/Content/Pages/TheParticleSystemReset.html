<h1>Reset()</h1>

<h3>public static void Reset()</h3>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
public static void Reset()
{   //acts as a constructor as well
	if (texture == null)
	{   //set up a general texture we can draw dots with, if required
		texture = new Texture2D(Data.GDM.GraphicsDevice, 1, 1);
		texture.SetData<Color>(new Color[] { Color.White });
	}
	//reset particles to inactive state
	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{ data[i].Id = ParticleID.Inactive; }
	active = 0; //reset active count too
}

<p>
<b>The Reset() method</b> readies the Particle System for use, which involves creating<br>
a texture to use when we later draw these particles. This texture is created, and<br>
then all particles are looped and set to inactive. We also set the active count<br>
to 0, which is a value that we will use to count how many particles are active.<br>
<br>
After Game1.LoadContent() completes, the game settles into the pattern of<br>
Update(), Draw() being called every 16.6ms. Game passes these Update and Draw<br>
calls onto the Particle System, so let's look at the big Update method now.<br>
We will look at the Spawn() method in it's own article.<br>
