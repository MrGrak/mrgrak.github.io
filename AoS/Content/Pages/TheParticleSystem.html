<h1>The Particle System</h1>

<h3>Where the work gets done</h3>

<p>
The Particle System class is a Pool written over an Array of Structs.<br>
It has 4 methods, each explained below:<br>
<br>
<b>Reset()</b> - sets all particle structs to Inactive.<br>
<b>Spawn()</b> - spawns a particle at X, Y position, with acceleration.<br>
<b>Update()</b> - applies physics, manages particle states, culls, and spawns particles.<br>
<b>Draw()</b> - draws active particles.<br>
<br>
Here is the Game loop, which provides some context to the Particle System:<br>
Game1's constructor is called from Program Main, which sets up most of the<br>
common object references, like the reference to the game itself stored in Data.<br>
Then Game1.LoadContent() is called, where the SpriteBatch reference is set,<br>
and we first see Particle System's Reset() method.<br>
<br>
