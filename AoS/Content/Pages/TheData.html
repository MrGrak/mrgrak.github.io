<h1>The Data</h1>

<h3>An explanation of the classes and structs</h3>

<p>

Here is a quick overview of the classes this system uses:<br>
<br>
The Data Class - simply holds references for systems to use when they need to.<br>
The Physics Struct - contains floats describing positions and accelerations.<br>
The Particle ID Enumerator - an easy to read way of handling IDs for particles.<br>
The Particle Struct - describes a particle that has movement and color.<br>
The Particle System Class - creates, updates, and draws particle structs.<br>
The Game1 Class - your friendly neighborhood xna game class.<br>
<br>
Now, we'll go over each on in detail.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>public static class Data</h3><br>
<textarea rows="10" readonly>
public static class Data
{
	public static GraphicsDeviceManager GDM;
	public static ContentManager CM;
	public static SpriteBatch SB;
	public static Game1 GAME;
}
</textarea>

<p>This is a public static class (kinda like a singleton) that holds pointers<br>
to objects that the game's various system will need access to.<br>
You could instead pass these references into object constructors, but I<br>
choose to keep them in a class that is accessible from anywhere in the<br>
namespace. This design makes it easy to use these common objects.<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>







<h3>public struct Physics</h3><br>
<textarea rows="10" readonly>
public struct Physics
{
	public float X, Y; //current position
	public float accX, accY; //accelerations
	public float preX, preY; //last position
}
</textarea>

<p>This is a public struct contains floats for the x and y positions,<br>
along with the previous frame's x and y positions. There are also floats<br>
for the x and y accelerations. Later, we'll write a simple physics system<br>
that will move particles around with velocity and acceleration.<br>
<br>
Note that the Physics struct will is used like a component, in composing<br>
the Particle Struct.<br> 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>







<h3>public enum ParticleID</h3><br>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
public enum ParticleID : byte { Inactive, Fire, Rain }
</textarea>

<p>This is a public enumerator, so it essentially maps a String to an<br>
underlying type, like a byte. When compiled, the Strings are replaced<br>
with the underlying type value. So in the example above, Inactive = 0.<br>
Fire = 1, Rain = 2. Being able to replace these number values with<br>
strings makes later code easier and clearer to read.<br>
For the example, I've only defined 3 possible particle IDs, or states.<br>
You can add more here and make your own type of particles.<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>










<h3>public struct Particle</h3><br>
<textarea rows="10" readonly>
public struct Particle
{   //uses physics struct as component
	public Physics physics;
	public Color color;
	public float alpha;
	public ParticleID Id;
	public short age;
}
</textarea>

<p>
This is a public Particle struct, which contains a physics struct<br>
acting like a component. We could, for example, have a Projectile<br>
struct that is very similar to this Particle struct, which could<br>
also have a Physics struct. So, you can move shared fields to smaller<br>
structs, and treat them like components to compose other structs.<br>
<br>
The other fields contained in the Particle struct are used in the<br>
particle simulation. We have color and alpha so we can display particles<br>
with different ids as different colors. The ParticleID field is the<br>
enumerator from above, which will make particles easy to identify later.<br>
<br>
Finally, we have the particle's age, which can be any value you want,<br>
but I've never found the need to have a particle live longer than the<br>
max size of a short, so I use a short here. Each frame, this age value<br>
will get incremented, and once it exceeds a specific threshold, the<br>
particle's ID will be changed to Inactive. If a particle is inactive,<br>
it is not updated or drawn, effectively 'removing' it from the simulation.<br>
<br>
Now it's time to talk about the Particle System itself, which I've broken<br>
up into separate articles.<br>
