<p>
This Draw method opens up SpriteBatch, and starts checking the Particle Array<br>
for active Ids, just like Update() does. When an active Id is found, we copy<br>
the particles position into a Vector2 and pass that into Monogame's SpriteBatch,<br>
along with the particle's color + alpha. We use the texture created before to draw<br>
all the particles with, so all these particles are submitted in one draw call.<br>
<br>
Now let's look at the last method, Spawn, in the next article.
