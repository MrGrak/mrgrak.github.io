<h1>Select 3D and Vfx Work</h1>

<p>
Once upon a time, I did visual fx and worked/lived in 3d Studio Max.<br>
On this page are a few videos that I personally still like, and find interesting.<br>
There's more on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/garrickcampsey/videos">my old youtube channel</a>.<br>

A 2009 short vfx video inspired by District9. I just put a spaceship in the sky, with some helicoptors.<br>
Motiontracking the ship to the clouds was a very difficult process and had to be done by hand.<br>

A 30 second titles pitch I got to do for a film in 2012. <br>
Used maxscript to create motiongraphics components in 3d that were auto-rigged for faster production times.<br>
Maxscript is a scripting language in 3ds Max, which runs ontop of .Net and C#.<br>
Bonus: you can write and compile C# directly using maxscript. It's like python for C#, in 3d.<br>

A 6 second animation I entered into an online animation competition in 2010.<br>
Models were provided for all contestants, without any rigging. I did all rigging and animation.<br>
In the middle of animation, I realized I could use the camera as a 3rd actor, to give the scene more life.<br>

A test of a script/tool I wrote called Stretchy Bones Creator, in 2010.<br>
The goal of the tool was to automate and simplify facial rigging as much as possible.<br>
Here is a video showing the tool autorigging eyebrows: <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/or7H-yADSxg">https://youtu.be/or7H-yADSxg</a>.<br>
Here is a video showing a full facial rig, rendered, controls, and bones:<br>

The tool worked very well in most cases, and was largely based on the idea of 'avars', from Pixar.<br>
You can learn more about avars here: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avar_(animation_variable)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avar_(animation_variable)</a>.<br>

A 2011 video showing an android mesh I modeled for a project I never completed. Completely rigged too.<br>

A 2010 tool for art directing destruction, using particle systems, that also ignores collisions (so it's super fast).<br>
Used for an animation (that was super rushed) entered into an online competition.<br>


<br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iy0OeU6rzn8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
A 2012 video about planes and aliens, where I worked with a small team, completed in 48 days (2.24.12 to 4.16.2018).<br>


<br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQG8Tv2ZqZQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
A 2009 video featuring a robot similar to Walle exploring the world.<br>


<br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcpToEOyS8Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
A 2010 video where I match moved, rendered, and composited a 3d object into 2d footage.<br>


<br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qA_-wU8khiE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
A 2011 tool that let users build maxscript tools in maxscript. Reduced prototyping script times, for me.<br>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbWBoNsVIXs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
Testing MassFX via Nvidia Physx engine with "CloneTroopers" for fun. Didnt work for large scale stuff too well.<br>



<br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNRGN05EX3c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
A 2011 tool that auto-builds droids based on parameters or rules.<br>
The geometry created is also properly modeled for hard-surface subdivision.<br>




<br>
<br>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70FkdaizI0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
A 2011 tool that merges pre-modeled and rigged characters, then applies animation files to them.<br>
The entire character is then parented to a control on the ground, which the tool uses to manage the character.<br>
This allowed me to produce tremendous amounts of work very quickly using characters and animations.<br>
It was called Tiny because at the time crowd management was done by a tool called Massive, that was expensive.<br>
