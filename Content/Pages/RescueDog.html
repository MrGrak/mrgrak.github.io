<h1>RescueDog</h1>

<p>
A top-down 2D game, where you play a dog leading a human through a cave-like maze.<br>

RescueDog was the first game that I wanted to make publicly.<br>
It was originally embedded into the Monogame Getting Started Guide, as an example.<br>
I decided this made the Guide too cluttered and complex, so I moved RescueDog out.<br>
Overall, I'm happy with the development of RescueDog as it happened in 7 days.<br>
<br>
The Game's public repo is located here:

<br>
<b>Sidenote:</b> while trying to design a game that was 'simple', I found myself battling scope.<br>
This led me to question common beliefs about how object references and scope should be handled.<br>
This code base is in a semi-oop style, with lots of reference passing happening.<br>
