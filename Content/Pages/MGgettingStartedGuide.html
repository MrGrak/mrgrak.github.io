<h1>Monogame Getting Started Guide</h1>

<p>
The Getting Started Guide was written in about 3 weeks during August 2016.<br>
It's aim is to be a simple explanation of how to use Monogame to do basic tasks.<br>
Such things as drawing images and fonts to the screen are explained.<br>
Other concepts like input, classes, and full screen programs are discussed as well.<br>
<br>
This guide's content was based on my experiences developing games for the xbox360 + Pc, using XNA.<br>
Moving from XNA to Monogame seemed like it would be easy, but there were subtle issues.<br>
In a way, this guide is a record of how I solved certain problems, and as such is not all inclusive.<br>
The Guide's public repo is located here:
