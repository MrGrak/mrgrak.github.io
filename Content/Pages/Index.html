<h1>Introductions</h1>

<p>
Hi, I'm MrGrak.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in creating video games, applications, and efficient C# code.<br>
I mostly work as a solo developer, by choice. Faster development, less communication.<br>
I've found working alone also allows me a great deal of control over the final product.<br>
I also consider myself a Computer Scientist, but more Cave Johnson than Alan Turing.<br>
<br>
Due to my particular nature, for entertainment I enjoy testing and breaking rules.<br>
This leads me to do things in C# that some would deem questionable, bizzare, and wrong.<br>
My other nature drives me to do things as well as possible, as efficiently as possible.<br>
This leads me to refactor and redesign systems and data/functionality flow as I understand more.<br>
<br>
By far, my favorite problem domain is 2D top down games.<br>
I've been working in that problem domain since 2012, and will continue doing so indefinitely.<br>
My current game is attempting to improve the top down 2d Zelda genre:<br>

<h3>Navigations On The Left</h3>
Use the menu or navigation to the left to look at various things I've made.<br>
These are ideas, guides, games, applications - all provided for free, without license.<br>
I believe that ideas and information should be available to everyone, without restriction.<br>
Use my code and ideas to make money, to get jobs, to make the world better.<br>
These principles drive me to share things that I find valueable or useful.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Code Examples</h3>
Sometimes, there will be code. It looks like this, and is in C#:<br>

<textarea rows="4" readonly>
//this is a block of C# code that will appear from time to time
</textarea>

Thanks for stopping by.<br>
