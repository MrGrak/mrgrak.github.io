<h1>The Shadow King</h1>

<p>
A top-down 2D zelda-game, where you play a hero who defeats bosses in dungeons and coliseums.<br>
The Game's public repo is located here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MrGrak/TSK">https://github.com/MrGrak/TSK</a><br>
<br>
This project is on going and still in development, which started on March 12, 2017.<br>
This project's current goal is to be a new and well done Zelda game.<br>
It's secondary goal is to be an example of pure mutable game design, at scale.<br>

The Shadow King initially started as just an attempt to make my own Zelda game.<br>
Once that was achieved, I started experimenting with what was possible.<br>
I just wanted to make Zelda better and funner, but doing so required alot of time.<br>
I've created a page that shows <a href="TheShadowKingMakingOf.html" target="display">The Development Timeline</a>.<br>

<h3>Version 0.79 - 01.27.19</h3>

Version 0.79 added a ton of polish and bug fixes, along with tons of crazy ideas.<br>
